      <description>Explorer Endpoints Explorer endpoints serve individual large JSON objects and a few related lists. JSON objects use the typical JSON key/value structure and you cannot limit the contents of objects (i.e. they are always sent in full). CSV format is not supported here.
Most explorer endpoints take different kinds of path arguments to define the object to return. This can be:
 a regular hash for blocks, operations or accounts the string head for the most recent object on the blockchain (e.</description>

      <description>Table Endpoints  Generic Table Query
 https://api.tzstats.com/tables/{table_code}.{format}?{args}  Tables store data in tabular form as a set of columns. Each column has a specified type and each row has a unique uint64 row_id. Empty values are represented as JSON null or empty strings. Tables can grow extremely large, so its good practice to use filters and the columns query argument to limit the result size. Table responses are automatically sorted by row_id.</description>

      <description>Time-Series Endpoints  Generic Time-Series Query
 https://api.tzstats.com/series/{table_code}.{format}?{args}  The time-series API is an abstraction over tables which allows for server-side aggregation of multiple result rows over time. Time-series are meant to be displayed as graphs with time on the x-axis and some aggregate value on the y-axis. Since the underlying data is still in tabular form all table filters work on time-series as well.
Note that this time-series API does not fill gaps.</description>
